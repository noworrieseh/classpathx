The IMAP4 provider is a separate IMAP provider, written from scratch for
performance and to remove the Scheme-interpreter dependency.

It uses a generic IMAPConnection object to manage the IMAP protocol level.

This provider is still under active development: use at your own risk!

If you want to help get it stable, please contact dog@gnu.org
