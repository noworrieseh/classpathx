This is GNU JavaMail 1.5, part of the GNU classpathx project.

Please refer to the INSTALL file for installation instructions,
and the COPYING file for licensing.

  General

This package fully implements the public J2EE JavaMail API, version 1.5.0,
and adds a number of features not available in the reference implementation
by Oracle, including:

    - mbox provider
    - Maildir provider
    - NNTP (store and transport) provider
    - full source code and copyleft license

All GNU JavaMail network providers support SSL/TLS connections, both on the
initial connection and via STARTTLS-type mechanisms wherever the server
supports it. You are encouraged to protect your own privacy and that of your
users by using these security features, either by specifying the "s" versions
of the relevant protocols in URLs (e.g. "imaps:", "pop3s:", "nntps:") or by
ensuring that the "mail.tls" session property is set (it is set by default
but can be overridden on a per-provider basis). If you have to access a
server via unencrypted means, all the providers except NNTP support SASL
authentication which can be used to ensure that at least your credentials are
not passed in plaintext over the network.

  Prerequisites

In order to build GNU JavaMail you must have a modern (>=1.5) Java compiler
such as OpenJDK, and the inetlib-1.2 and GNU JAF libraries installed. The
latter are also part of GNU classpathx. The build process will create a single
jar file containing all the classes you need from these libraries.
