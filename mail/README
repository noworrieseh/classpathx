The configuration system for classpathx javamail is not yet complete.

Nic and DOG worked out the details over email. This is a rundown of
what they decided.


Providers will be selected at configure time. User's will type
something like this:

  ./configure --with-nntp --with-imap

would cause the imap and nntp providers to be compiled.

The SMTP transport is compiled by default.


Also needed is some way of selecting the default store and the default
transport. That could be done by further use of "--with" conf options.


The files in this directory will eventually allow this to be
done. Confugure.in will generate configure which will cause the
Makefile and the javamail.providers files to be built from their
respective .in files.
