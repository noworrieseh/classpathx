Installing GNU JavaMail


Dependencies

GNU JavaMail depends on a JAF implementation and GNU inetlib. GNU
distributes its own JAF implementation as part of the ClasspathX project:

  http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/

The GNU inetlib library is a separate module within the aegis of the
Classpath project:

	http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/

Compiled jarfiles of both libraries are distributed along with this package,
in the lib subdirectory. At runtime, you will need to reference these
libraries in your classpath along with the JavaMail jarfiles.


Configuration

The configure program configures GNU JavaMail for your system. The various
programs required to build GNU JavaMail should be automatically identified.
If they aren't, or you wish to override the default programs found, you can
do so here. Set the environment variable corresponding to the program you
wish to change befre running configure, e.g.:

	JAVAC=/my/special/javac ./configure

The default should work for most environments:

	./configure

You can exclude specific providers from being built if you want to save
space. Set the corresponding configuration option to "no", e.g.:

	./configure --enable-nntp=no --enable-maildir=no

A full list of configuration options is available by entering:

	./configure --help

at the comand prompt.


Building

To build GNU JavaMail, type the following at the command prompt:

	make

You may additionally build the API documentation in Javadoc format:

	make javadoc
