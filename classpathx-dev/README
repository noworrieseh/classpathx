The Classpathx developers files

This module exists to maintain various common files that all
developers of Classpathx projects might need.

Here's the description of what all the files do or are for:


  footer.html		the GNU webpages footer, used during javadoc
			generation.

  templateGPL.java  	the comment code to put at the very top 
  templateLGPL.jav	of all source files. Usage isn't mandatory
			but it helps if all projects use the same 
			header.

  tools.el		some emacs lisp tools for handling code 
			submitted to the classpathx project.
