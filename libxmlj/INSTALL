GNU LibxmlJ Installation Instructions
========================================================================

Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GNU LibxmlJ depends on the following packages which you must download
and install first:

- The XML C library for Gnome (Libxml2)
  http://www.xmlsoft.org/
  Tested with: 2.5.1 and 2.5.3

- The XSLT C library for Gnome (Libxslt)
  http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/
  Tested with: 10.0.24 and 10.0.26

- The Java API for XML Processing (JAXP)
  http://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/jaxp/ 
  Tested with: GNU JAXP 1.0 beta 1

- An up-to-date version of gcc/gcj is recommended, 3.3 is known to
  work.

Note that gcj is no requirement, you can also use LibxmlJ with your
favorite Java SDK (you will still need a C compiler, though.)  You may
have to pass --with-java-home or other configuration parameters to
configure. See below.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: Add `gnujaxp.jar' (produced by the GNU JAXP build scripts)
to your CLASSPATH environment variable first.

Change to the directory where you unpacked LibxmlJ to and issue the
following commands:

       ./configure
       make
       make check       (optional - doesn't do much at the time)
       make install

Run ./configure --help for a list of package-specific options.

The default prefix is `/usr/local'. Running above will produce a
shared library at `/usr/local/lib/libxmlj.so' and a Java archive at
`/usr/local/share/libxmlj.jar'.

Make sure that libxmlj.jar and libxmlj.so are on your CLASSPATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, resp. If the shared library has been properly
ldconfig'ed, you needn't care about LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For usage information see README.
