Installing GNU JAF

There's no installation target yet. But you can use
autoconf/automakejar to build the activation.jar.

With autoconf 2.52 installed do this:

 $  aclocal

This will setup the macros needed by the autoconf script. In
particular it installs the JAVA_CC_PROG macro which selects java
compilers based on a list. At the moment GCJ is used if it is found.

 $  autoconf
 $ ./automakejar

Running automakejar creates the Makefile.in.

 $ ./configure
 $ make

The activation.jar is left in the make directory (the directory where
you typed make).
