<p>
The <i>GNU Classpath Extensions</i> project builds free versions of Sun's
Java extension libraries, the packages in the <code>javax</code>
namespace. It is a companion project of the 
<a href='/software/classpath/'>GNU Classpath</a> project.
</p>

<p>
ClasspathX produces vendor neutral Java code: it should work with
any VM. However, we particularly want the code to work with free VMs
such as <a href='http://gcc.gnu.org/java'>gij</a> and
<a href='http://www.kaffe.org/'>kaffe</a>.
</p>


<h3><a name='help-wanted'>We need help</a></h3>

<p>
Attempting to build free versions of ALL of Sun's Java extensions
is a big job and we need your help to get everything done. If you are
a Java programmer and you want to work on building free Java
extensions then get in touch with either
<a href='mailto:dog@gnu.org'>Chris Burdess</a> or <a
href='mailto:arnaud.vandyck@ulg.ac.be'>Arnaud Vandyck</a>
who will be happy to give you something interesting to do!
</p>

<p>
If you want to write code you must assure us that you
have not seen the source code for the API you want to work on. If you
have seen Sun's source code we can't accept your contributions as they
would put the entire project at risk from legal action.
</p>

<p>
If you can't contribute code, either because you don't think you're
qualified or you've seen Sun's source code, you can still be of
tremendous help to us. We need testers and people to write
documentation as well as hackers!
</p>


<h3><a name='mailing-lists'>Keep in touch</a></h3>

<p>
To know what's going on with the project you can subscribe to our
very low volume <i>announcements</i> mailing list by sending a mail with the
subject line:
<pre>
  subscribe
</pre>
to the address 
<a href='mailto:classpathx-annouce-request@gnu.org'>classpathx-announce-request@gnu.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in becomming a developer it may be useful to
track one of the development mailing lists. There is a mailing list
for each major project. Check the individual project pages (or the
savannah system) for more info. There is a general discussion list for
classpathx developers which you can join by sending a mail with the
subject:
<pre>
  subscribe

to the address
<a href='mailto:classpathx-discuss-request@gnu.org'>classpathx-discuss-request@gnu.org</a>.

</ul>


<h3><a name='releases'>Releases</a></h3>

<p>
Releases for each separate part of the ClasspathX project are
maintained, well, seperately. Check each project's page for details.
</p>

<p>
We do not plan to offer a full ClasspathX download, but if you'd be
interested in having one you should maybe let 
<a href="mailto: classpathx-discuss@gnu.org">us</a> know.
</p>


<h3><a name='development'>Development</a></h3>

<p>
Development for ClasspathX occurs on the 
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/classpathx">savannah</a>
free software collaboration system. You can view our code in CVS from
there. If you want to help us you will need to become a savannah user.
</p>


<h3><a name='acknowledgements'>Acknowledgements</a></h3>

<p>
Andrew Selkirk started this project as an open source effort in
2000. He did all of the hard work creating the free versions of the various
javax APIs listed above. He was also gracious enough to hand on the
work to the GNU project when he found himself too busy to
continue. Andrew stays in touch with the project and we'd like to give a 
a <b>very</b> big thank you to Andrew for his effort, vision 
and magnanimity.
</p>

<p>
David Brownell contributed the JAXP, SAX and DOM code.
With another hat, he's a maintainer for the SAX2 interfaces.
Thanks for the help David!
</p>

<p>
Chris Burdess (aka dog) wrote the JavaMail and JAF implementations and
providers.
</p>

<p>
Paul Siegmann, who wrote the original free version of the servlet API 
and trailblazed the legalities of the GNU project clean rooming javax
source code. Paul spent many days typing in code worked out from
javadoc. He deserves a lot of thanks, so...<br>
Lots of thanks Paul!
