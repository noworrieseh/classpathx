4 - Indentation
Do not use tabs.  Always use spaces.  Three spaces should be used as the unit of
indentation.

(in the manual, translate the "8-space" rule or references to "6 spaces").

6.1 Number Per Line
Only use one space between the type and the identifier.

9 - Naming Conventions
In general, write it as you pronounce it.  For example, we say "U R L" and not
"Url" to refer to a URL; an acceptable class name would then be "URLBlah" and
not "UrlBlah".

Interfaces: Interface names always start with uppercase-i.


In addition to the above, classes and interfaces should follow a similar pattern
to that of AClass.java.tmpl (for classes) and IAnInterface.java.tmpl (for
interfaces).  Both these templates are located in the etc/ directory.
