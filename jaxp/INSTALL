GNU jaxp Installation Instructions
========================================================================

Dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GNU jaxp depends on the following packages which you must download and
install first:

- The XML C library for Gnome (Libxml2)
  http://www.xmlsoft.org/
  Tested with: 2.5.1 and 2.5.3

- The XSLT C library for Gnome (Libxslt)
  http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/
  Tested with: 10.0.24 and 10.0.26

- An up-to-date version of gcc/gcj is recommended, 3.3 is known to
  work.

Note that gcj is no requirement, you can also use GNU jaxp with your
favorite Java SDK (you will still need a C compiler, though.)  You may
have to pass --with-java-home or other configuration parameters to
configure. See below.


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change to the directory where you unpacked GNU jaxp to and issue the
following commands:

       ./configure
       make
       make check       (optional - doesn't do much at the time)
       make install

Run ./configure --help for a list of package-specific options.

The default prefix is `/usr/local'. Running above will produce a
shared library at `/usr/local/lib/libxmlj.so' and a Java archive at
`/usr/local/share/gnujaxp.jar'.

Make sure that gnujaxp.jar and libxmlj.so are on your CLASSPATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, resp. If the shared library has been properly
ldconfig'ed, you needn't care about LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For usage information see README.
