<p> This package provides the core SAX1 and SAX2 APIs.
SAX1 APIs are deprecated to encourage integration of
namespace-awareness into designs of new applications
and maintainance of existing infrastructure.
For more information on SAX, see
<a href="http://www.megginson.com/SAX/index.html">the SAX page</a>.

<h2> SAX2 Standard Feature Flags </h2>

<p> One of the essential characteristics of SAX2 is that it added
feature flags that can be used to examine and perhaps modify
parser modes, in particular modes such as validation.
Since features are identified by (absolute) URIs, anyone
can define such features.   
Currently defined standard feature URIs have the prefix
<code>http://xml.org/sax/features/</code> before an identifier such as
<code>validation</code>.  One could turn that feature on or off using
<em>setFeature</em>.  Those standard identifiers are: </p>


<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr align="center" bgcolor="#ccccff">
	<th>Feature ID</th>
	<th>Default</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>external-general-entities</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em></td>
	<td> Reports whether this parser processes external
	    general entities; always true if validating</td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>external-parameter-entities</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em></td>
	<td> Reports whether this parser processes external
	    parameter entities; always true if validating</td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>namespaces</td>
	<td>true</td>
	<td> true indicates namespace URIs and unprefixed local names
	    for element and attribute names will be available </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>namespace-prefixes</td>
	<td>false</td>
	<td> true indicates XML 1.0 names (with prefixes) and attributes
	    (including <em>xmlns*</em> attributes) will be available </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>string-interning</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em></td>
	<td> true if all XML names provided will have been interned
	    using <em>java.lang.String.intern</em>, supporting fast
	    testing of equality/inequality with string constants </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>validation</td>
	<td><em>unspecified</em> (false?)</td>
	<td> controls whether the parser is validating its input </td>
	</tr>

</table>

<h2> SAX2 Standard Handler and Property IDs </h2>

<p> For parser interface characteristics that aren't boolean
flags, a separate namespace for objects is defined.  The
objects in this namespace are again identified by URI, and
the standard property URIs have the prefix
<code>http://xml.org/sax/properties/</code> before an identifier such as
<code>lexical-handler</code> or
<code>dom-node</code>.  One could manage those properties using
<em>setProperty()</em>.  Those identifiers are: </p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <tr align="center" bgcolor="#ccccff">
	<th>Property ID</th>
	<th>Description</th>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>declaration-handler</td>
	<td> Used to see most DTD declarations except those treated
	    as lexical ("root element name is ...") or which are
	    mandatory for all SAX parsers (<em>DTDHandler</em>).
	    The Object must implement <em>DeclHandler</em>.  </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>dom-node</td>
	<td> For "DOM Walker" style parsers, which ignore their
	    <em>parser.parse()</em> parameters, this is used to
	    specify the DOM (sub)tree being walked by the parser.
	    </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>lexical-handler</td>
	<td> Used to see some syntax events that are essential in some
	    applications:  comments, CDATA delimeters, selected general
	    entity inclusions, and the start and end of the DTD.
	    The Object must implement <em>LexicalHandler</em>.  </td>
	</tr>

    <tr>
	<td>xml-string</td>
	<td> Readable only during a parser callback, this exposes a TBS
	    chunk of characters responsible for the current event. </td>
	</tr>

</table>


<h2> SAX2 Namespace Support </h2>

<p> Namespace support is the root of the incompatibilities between 
SAX1 and SAX2. 
Namespaces are not part of XML itself, but are felt to be
sufficiently strategic that this layer has been integrated
into the SAX2 API.
Existing applications needs to change two method signatures, and add
two new handler methods, to handle SAX2 namespace features.

<p>
Names in the <a href="ContentHandler.html">ContentHandler</a> startElement
and endElement callback must now, by default, conform to the XML + Namespaces
specification.  You will get two callbacks describing the beginning and end
of a scope for a given name prefix, and may also see the attributes
which tell you that same thing.  (As a rule, ignore those callbacks.)

<p> If you explicitly enable the <em>namespace-prefixes</em>
feature on a parser, you can see the <em>xmlns*</em> attributes, and
the element and attribute names as found in the document (with prefixes).
If your SAX1 application is currently namespace aware, or needs to work
with data that may use prefixed (or perhaps hierarchical) names, you must
enable that feature in order to continue working correctly with a SAX2
parser, in addition to making the various call syntax changes.
(You can phase in use of the SAX2 namespace features incrementally,
as you verify that it's safe for use with each existing application's
data set or messaging partner.)
