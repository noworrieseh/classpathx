/**
 * Basic interface for SAX (Simple API for XML) parsers.

 * <em>This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 * Public Domain, and comes with <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>.</em>
 * See <a href='http://www.saxproject.org'>http://www.saxproject.org</a>

 *
 * <p>This was the main event supplier interface for SAX1; it has
 * been replaced in SAX2 by {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader XMLReader},
 * which includes Namespace support and sophisticated configurability
 * and extensibility.</p>
 *
 * <p>All SAX1 parsers must implement this basic interface: it allows
 * applications to register handlers for different types of events
 * and to initiate a parse from a URI, or a character stream.</p>
 *
 * <p>All SAX1 parsers must also implement a zero-argument constructor
 * (though other constructors are also allowed).</p>
 *
 * <p>SAX1 parsers are reusable but not re-entrant: the application
 * may reuse a parser object (possibly with a different input source)
 * once the first parse has completed successfully, but it may not
 * invoke the parse() methods recursively within a parse.</p>
 *
 * @deprecated This interface has been replaced by the SAX2
 *             {@link org.xml.sax.XMLReader XMLReader}
 *             interface, which includes Namespace support.
