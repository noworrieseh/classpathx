/**
 * <p> "Attr" implementation.  In DOM, attributes cost quite a lot of
 * memory because their values are complex structures rather than just
 * simple strings.  To reduce your costs, avoid having more than one
 * child of an attribute; stick to a single Text node child, and ignore
 * even that by using the attribute's "nodeValue" property.</p>
 *
 * <p> As a bit of general advice, only look at attribute modification
 * events through the DOMAttrModified event (sent to the associated
 * element).  Implementations are not guaranteed to report other events
 * in the same order, so you're very likely to write nonportable code if
 * you monitor events at the "children of Attr" level.</p>
 *
 * <p> At this writing, not all attribute modifications will cause the
 * DOMAttrModified event to be triggered ... only the ones using the string
 * methods (setNodeValue, setValue, and Element.setAttribute) to modify
 * those values.  That is, if you manipulate those children directly,
 * elements won't get notified that attribute values have changed.
 * The natural fix for that will report other modifications, but won't 
 * be able to expose "previous" attribute value; it'll need to be cached
 * or something (at which point why bother using child nodes). </p>
 *
 * <p><em>You are strongly advised not to use "children" of any attribute
 * nodes you work with.</em> </p>
