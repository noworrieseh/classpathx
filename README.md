A little project I kicked off around 2000.  It was a different time.  Java wasn't as open as it is now and most of the focus was on the jvm and stdlib.  

It started off at sourceforge.  I sent a snailmail to Richard Stallman asking what he thought and received a response encouraging it.

When work and home life got too busy, Nic picked it up and did a great writeup at https://www.gnu.org/software/classpathx/.  It was awesome to see others jump in to fill out the apis.
